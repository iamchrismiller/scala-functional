Scala Functional Programming Learnings and exercises roughly based on Coursera Class

As I learn functional principles in Scala I will compile a list of exercises completed

All exercises are tested using [scalatest](http://www.scalatest.org/) and executed with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

## Exercises

- Factorials (Simple / Tail-Recursion)
  - In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.

- Pascal Triangle (Simple / Tail-Recursion)
  - In mathematics, Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal in much of the Western world

- More to Come...
